## Overview
    This C++ code consists of three different algorithms that solve the Traveling Salesman problem. These algorithms include a Brute Force Algorithm, a Nearest Neighbor Algorithm, and an original algorithm. These algorithms are implemented in a single file where the desired algorithm or algorithms can be selected for execution.I made a few assumptions: nodes are labeled in numarical order starting at 0, no nodes were named the same, and that the graph was undirected and complete.

## Setup
    To use my C++ file, two variables must be specified at the start of the file. 
        [1]The first variable is a string that holds the input file name for the triangle matrix, and the second variable is an enumerated variable used to specify the algorithm or algorithms. 
        The enumerated variable can be set to “all” (meaning all algorithms calculated), brute (only brute force method calculated), “neighbor” (only nearest neighbor algorithm used), “mine” (only my swapping implementaFon is used), and “neighborMine” (to calculate using the nearest neighbor and my implementaFon). 
    
    For the input file to be read correctly, it must have the triangular matrix with no addiFonal whitespace at the end of the file.
